a small book store web app the idea is to make a webapp that unables the user to add books to the cart and either they can checkout the items in the cart or else they can remove it from the cart .

as for the client side the idea is to use html and css and vanilla js .
for the serever side node and express
and for the database its going to be mongo db.
